## How it works

Frontend (this repo)

But this repository is referring only to the Frontend part.

### Pre-requisites

Before you begin, you will need to have the following tools installed on your machine:
[Git] (https://git-scm.com), [Node.js] (https://nodejs.org/en/).
In addition, it is good to have an editor to work with the code like [VSCode] (https://code.visualstudio.com/)

#### Running the web application (Frontend)

```bash

# Clone this repository
$ git clone git@github.com:ranjithpmankada/machine-test-1.git

# Access the project folder in your terminal
$ cd machine-test-1

# Install the dependencies
$ npm -i

# Run the application in development mode
$ npm run dev

# The application will open on the port: 5173 - go to http://localhost:5173

```
